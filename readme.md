# Python Automation Projects

Welcome to the Python Automation Projects repository! üêç‚ú®

Here, you will find a collection of diverse Python automation projects that aim to simplify your life and boost your productivity. Each project showcases the power of automation using Python, demonstrating how we can delegate repetitive tasks to our trusty machines and save valuable time.

## Countdown GUI

The **Countdown GUI** is an exciting project that provides a glimpse into the world of Python automation. It is a simple graphical user interface created using Python's tkinter GUI toolkit, where you can track the days until a specific event, such as the start of a new semester or an upcoming vacation. This project is designed to inspire you and serve as an excellent starting point for your own automation endeavours.

### Key Features

- Intuitive GUI: Well, I know the universal definition of intuitive, but I'll still assert that the UI is intuitive. The user-friendly interface allows you to easily view the countdown.

- Automation Potential: This project illustrates how Python can automate time-related tasks, providing a practical example of leveraging technology to simplify your schedule.

    A real example of how this could be automated is to set it to launch after every PC startup. For windows:

    - Launch *Run* using `Win+R`
    - In the prompt that opens, type `shell:startup` and click OK

    - Add the script to the folder that comes up. Now every time your PC starts up, the script will run to display the countdown GUI.
